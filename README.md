# Tar WTF

This is the source code for https://tar-wtf.com, a web UI designed to help you successfully craft a unix `tar` command. I've never been able to remember all the command line switches, so this tool acts as your second brain (but just for tar and not all that other important stuff you can't remember).

## Development setup

1. **Install dependencies.**

    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

1.  **Start the app.**
